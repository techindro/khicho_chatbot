## 🎨 How Can You Help?

Here are some cool areas we are actively looking to improve:
- **Style Presets:** Adding more creative options inside `src/constants.js`.
- **UI/UX Aesthetics:** Making our Midjourney-inspired dark mode even more immersive with micro-interactions.
- **Mobile Packaging:** Optimizing components to run perfectly as a hybrid Android/iOS app using Capacitor.
- **Documentation:** Improving README files, writing helpful code comments, or building beginner tutorials.

## 📝 Code Style & Guidelines

To keep the codebase healthy, clean, and easy to read:
- **Functional Components:** We use modern React with hooks. Keep components focused, reusable, and neat.
- **CSS Variables:** Avoid hardcoding hex colors. Use the CSS tokens defined in `src/index.css` (e.g., `var(--bg)`, `var(--surface)`, `var(--text-secondary)`) so that both light and dark modes render beautifully.
- **Preserve Clean Code:** Please keep existing comments and explain your logic if you are introducing complex routing.
- **Build Verification:** Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing to make sure the bundler compiles everything with zero errors.
